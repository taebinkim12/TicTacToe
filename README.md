# TicTacToe
## Introduction
- This program allows a human user to play a game of TicTacToe against the algorithm that I have designed on console

## Running this Program
1. Download/clone the code
2. Move to directory where you have cloned the code
3. Execute following command on your choice of terminal
```
$ java tictactoeFinal.java
```

## Description of Algorithm
- Algorithm used in this project was constructed by analyzing all possible moves in terms of their relative position
- A main goal of this algorithm is NOT to loose which implies that it will make defensive moves

## How to play
- Each cell in the board is marked as follows
```
[1] [2] [3]
[4] [5] [6]
[7] [8] [9]
```
- To make your move, type in the cell number where you wish to make your move at
- You(the user) will get the `O` marker where my algorithm will mark its move with `X`
- Deciding which user gets to play first is randomly decided

### Thank you!
